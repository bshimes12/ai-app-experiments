1. Scenario: Implementing a training program to educate employees on what needs to be cleaned and how to properly clean it. 

- Probable outcome: Employees may initially resist the training program as they may feel overwhelmed or uninterested in learning how to clean. However, with proper communication and incentives, they may eventually become more engaged in the training and understand the importance of cleaning for safety reasons.

- Repercussions: If employees do not adhere to the training and continue to neglect cleaning responsibilities, there is a heightened risk of slip and fall incidents occurring again. This could result in further injuries, legal liability, and potential damage to the reputation of the business.

2. Scenario: Hiring a professional cleaning service to regularly clean the building to prevent future accidents and ensure compliance with safety regulations. 

- Probable outcome: The professional cleaning service may provide thorough and consistent cleaning, reducing the risk of slip and fall incidents. This can lead to improved safety standards and a healthier work environment for employees.

- Repercussions: While hiring a professional cleaning service may seem like a straightforward solution, it can be costly for the business. If budget constraints are not taken into consideration, the financial impact may outweigh the benefits of outsourcing cleaning services. Additionally, relying on an external service may not address the underlying issue of lack of knowledge and training among employees regarding cleaning procedures.
