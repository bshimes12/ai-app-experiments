Scenario 1: Implementing a meal planning system
- Outcome: By implementing a meal planning system, you will have a pre-determined list of meals for the week, making it easier to shop for ingredients and prepare healthy and easy options.
- Repercussions: Family members may resist the idea of having their meals planned out for them, feeling like they have less control over what they eat. It may also be challenging to stick to the meal plan if unexpected events or cravings arise.

Scenario 2: Using a meal delivery service
- Outcome: Meal delivery services can provide ready-to-eat healthy meals, taking the stress out of deciding what to make for dinner.
- Repercussions: This option can be costly and may not be sustainable in the long run. There may also be limited options for dietary restrictions or preferences.

Scenario 3: Creating a rotating dinner menu
- Outcome: By creating a rotating dinner menu with a variety of healthy and easy options, you can streamline the decision-making process and ensure balanced meals.
- Repercussions: Family members may tire of eating the same meals repeatedly, leading to dissatisfaction with the dinner choices. It may also be time-consuming to come up with a diverse menu that everyone enjoys.

Overall, implementing a solution to the problem of not knowing what is for dinner can lead to positive outcomes such as saving time and ensuring healthier meals, but it may also come with challenges such as resistance from family members and difficulty in maintaining the new system. It is important to consider the preferences and needs of everyone involved when deciding on a solution.
