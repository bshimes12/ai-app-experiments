Here is my ranking of the solutions from most to least promising, along with some questions to address potential doubts:

1. Embrace a Growth Mindset
Questions:
- How can individuals sustain a growth mindset over the long-term, especially in the face of setbacks or failures?
- What specific strategies can organizations use to create a culture that supports and rewards a growth mindset?

2. Foster Meaningful Connections
Questions: 
- How can individuals balance the time and energy needed to build meaningful connections with the demands of their work?
- What role can organizations play in fostering an environment that encourages authentic human connection?

3. Integrate Tangible Experiences
Questions:
- How can individuals ensure that tangible experiences are truly fulfilling and not just a temporary distraction from their work?
- What support or resources can organizations provide to help employees pursue tangible experiences outside of work?

Reasoning:
I ranked "Embrace a Growth Mindset" as the most promising solution because it has the potential to fundamentally shift an individual's perspective and approach to their work. By reframing challenges as opportunities for learning and focusing on progress over perfection, individuals can find greater purpose and resilience in the face of abstract work. 

"Foster Meaningful Connections" is a close second because social support and a sense of belonging are critical for overall well-being and can help individuals find greater meaning in their work. However, building and maintaining deep connections requires ongoing time and effort.

I ranked "Integrate Tangible Experiences" last because while it can provide a valuable counterbalance to abstract work, it may be more challenging to implement on a regular basis and could potentially become a distraction if not managed carefully. 

Overall, a combination of all three solutions is likely to be most effective in helping individuals find purpose in abstract work over the long-term. Organizations also have an important role to play in creating environments that support a growth mindset, foster meaningful connections, and provide opportunities for tangible experiences.
