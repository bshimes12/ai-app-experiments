1. Enhanced Home Security
2. Package Lock Box
3. Delivery Alerts
4. Clear House Number and Instructions
5. Pickup Location

Reasoning:
1. A high-tech security system provides the most comprehensive solution. It could deter potential thieves, allow the homeowner to monitor package delivery in real time, and provide evidence if a package is stolen.
2. A secure lockbox for packages is also a strong solution as it provides a physical barrier to theft. However, it relies on delivery persons using it correctly.
3. Delivery alerts can help the homeowner retrieve packages quickly, reducing the window of opportunity for theft. But this solution is less secure as it depends on the homeowner's availability to retrieve the package promptly.
4. Clearly marking the house number and providing specific delivery instructions could help ensure that packages are delivered to the correct location. However, it does not directly prevent theft.
5. Using a secure package pickup location could be a good solution for some homeowners. However, it may be less convenient than home delivery, especially if the pickup location is not nearby.
