Evaluate each solution in 1. Check with neighbors: Ask your neighbors if they saw anything suspicious or if the package was mistakenly delivered to their address. It's possible that someone may have taken it by mistake or it was delivered to the wrong house.

2. Contact the delivery company: Reach out to the delivery company and provide them with the tracking number of the package. They may be able to investigate further and provide you with more information on the delivery status.

3. Install a security camera: Consider installing a security camera near your front porch to monitor any suspicious activity. This can help identify if someone stole the package or if it was accidentally misplaced.

4. Use a secure delivery box: Invest in a secure delivery box that can be locked to prevent theft. These boxes are designed to keep packages safe until you can retrieve them, even if you're not home at the time of delivery.

5. Improve visibility of house numbers: If the delivery driver had trouble finding your house due to poorly visible house numbers, consider installing larger or more visible numbers. This can help ensure that packages are delivered to the correct address in the future. by analyzing pros, cons, feasibility, and probability of success.

Based on the evaluations and reasoning, rank the solutions in Scenario 1: 
If a package goes missing and the homeowner suspects it may have been stolen, installing a security camera could be a valuable solution. The homeowner can purchase a security camera system and strategically install it to cover the area where packages are typically left. This could provide evidence in case of theft and help identify the perpetrator. 

Implementation Strategy: 
The homeowner can research different security camera systems, purchase one that fits their needs and budget, and follow the installation instructions to set it up. They can also consider consulting with a professional for optimal camera placement and setup. 

Partnerships Needed: 
No specific partnerships are needed for this solution, as the homeowner can independently purchase and install the security camera system.

Potential Obstacles: 
One potential obstacle could be the cost associated with purchasing a security camera system, as high-quality systems can be expensive. Additionally, technical issues may arise during installation or operation of the camera. The homeowner may need to troubleshoot or seek assistance to address these challenges. 

Overall, while installing a security camera may require an initial investment and maintenance, it can be a valuable deterrent against theft and provide peace of mind for the homeowner. from most to least promising.

1. Installing a security camera system: This solution ranks highest as it directly addresses the issue of potential theft and provides a way to gather evidence and identify perpetrators. It also does not require any partnerships and can be implemented independently by the homeowner.

Questions to address doubts:
- What is the cost range for quality security camera systems, and is there a budget-friendly option available?
- How easy is it to install and operate the security camera system for someone with little technical expertise?
- Are there any privacy concerns or regulations that need to be considered when installing a security camera on private property?

2. Checking with neighbors for any suspicious activity: This solution ranks lower as it may not always provide concrete evidence of theft and relies on the cooperation of neighbors. It also does not directly address the issue but rather seeks to gather information.

Questions to address doubts:
- How reliable is the information obtained from neighbors, and how likely are they to have noticed any suspicious activity?
- What steps can be taken if neighbors do not have any relevant information about the missing package?
- Is there a risk of escalating the situation by involving neighbors in the investigation?

3. Contacting the shipping company for compensation: This solution ranks lowest as it is a reactive measure after the package has already gone missing. It may also not be a guaranteed solution as compensation is not always provided for lost or stolen packages.

Questions to address doubts:
- What is the process for seeking compensation from the shipping company, and what evidence is needed to support the claim?
- How likely is it that the shipping company will provide compensation for a missing package, and what are the potential outcomes if they do not?
