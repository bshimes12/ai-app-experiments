        Excessive Food Waste in a Mid-Sized Restaurant
        Background:
        A mid-sized, farm-to-table restaurant, known for its commitment to sustainability and locally sourced ingredients, is facing a significant problem with food waste. Despite its best efforts to operate sustainably, the restaurant finds that a considerable portion of its food ends up being wasted. This not only contradicts its sustainability ethos but also leads to financial losses and impacts its reputation among environmentally conscious customers.

        Specific Challenges:
        Overordering and Inventory Mismanagement:

        The restaurant often orders more ingredients than needed, due to inaccurate forecasting of customer demand. This results in perishable items spoiling before they can be used.
        Lack of a proper inventory management system leads to ingredients being forgotten or overlooked until they are past their prime.
        Menu Design and Portion Sizes:

        The restaurant's menu includes dishes with components that lead to high waste levels, either because they require parts of ingredients that are not used elsewhere or because they have limited shelf life.
        Large portion sizes result in unfinished meals, which customers often do not take home, leading to waste.
        Inefficient Food Preparation Processes:

        Kitchen practices may contribute to waste, such as trimming more than necessary from vegetables or meats, or errors in preparation leading to unserved dishes.
        Lack of training for kitchen staff on how to minimize waste by using as much of an ingredient as possible (e.g., using vegetable peels for stocks).
        Lack of Customer Awareness and Engagement:

        Customers are unaware of the impact of their choices, such as requesting multiple side dishes they don't finish or not considering taking leftovers home.
        The restaurant has not effectively communicated its sustainability goals or engaged customers in its efforts to reduce waste.""",
                "THE_FACTORS": """Fluctuating Customer Numbers: Difficulty in predicting the number of customers, especially during special events or holidays, complicates inventory and portion size planning.
        Supplier Packaging: Ingredients come in pre-determined quantities or packaging that may not align with the restaurant's usage patterns, leading to excess.
        Cultural Norms and Expectations: Customers expect a variety of menu options and generous portion sizes, which pressures the restaurant to conform to these expectations, often at the expense of increased waste.
        Economic and Regulatory Challenges: Initiatives to reduce waste, such as composting or donating unused food, might be hindered by local regulations, lack of infrastructure, or financial constraints.
        Financial state of the restaurant: solutions cost additional money and the restaurant may be unable to absorb that cost.

"""
- **Introduction**: The municipality is facing community concerns over excess noise stemming from the increasing popularity of pickleball. Residents have reported disturbances, especially in areas adjacent to the courts.

- **Background**: Pickleball, a rapidly growing sport, has led to the establishment of multiple courts around the town. Although it promotes physical activity and community engagement, the noise generated by the game has become a source of contention, impacting the quality of life for nearby residents.

- **Problem Description**: The core issue revolves around the high levels of noise produced by pickleball activities, which affect the residents' daily lives, disrupts peace in neighborhoods, and potentially impacts property values. The problem is more pronounced during the early morning and late evening hours.

- **Scope**: This problem statement focuses on the noise impact of pickleball courts located within residential areas of the municipality. It excludes other noise-related complaints not directly linked to recreational sports facilities.

- **Direct and Indirect Consequences**: Residents experience decreased quality of life due to noise disturbances, potential decline in property values, and growing tensions between pickleball players and non-playing community members. If unaddressed, this may lead to increased complaints and legal challenges.

- **Objectives**: To mitigate the noise impact of pickleball courts while preserving the sport's accessibility and community benefits. Solutions should be practical, cost-effective, and aim to balance the interests of all community members.

- **Constraints and Limitations**: Solutions must consider budgetary constraints, the need for community support, potential resistance from pickleball enthusiasts, and the physical layout of existing facilities.

- **Assumptions**: It is assumed that the community values both peace and recreational activities and that a compromise solution can be reached through open dialogue and innovative thinking.

- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Stakeholders include affected residents, pickleball players, community sports organizations, local government officials, and property developers. Each has differing views on the importance and impact of the noise issue.

- **Urgency and Importance**: Addressing the noise complaints is of high urgency to improve community relations and ensure the sustainable growth of recreational sports within the municipality.

Here is a thorough problem statement following the provided template regarding the property dispute between two homeowners over the placement of a shared fence:

**Introduction**
Two neighboring homeowners are engaged in an ongoing dispute over the proper location of the fence separating their properties. Each homeowner believes the existing fence lies on the wrong side of the legal property line, leading to disagreement over the rightful boundaries and usable space of their respective yards.

**Background**  
The properties in question have well-established homes and yards, but based on differing interpretations of property surveys and land records, the precise legal boundary line separating the two parcels remains unclear. Attempts to resolve the dispute amicably through neighborly discussion have been unsuccessful so far.

**Problem Description**
Without a conclusively determined property line, the two homeowners continue to argue over where the fence separating their yards should be properly located. This ongoing dispute fosters tensions, bad feelings, and potential legal issues between the neighbors.

**Scope**
The core issue is specifically the disagreement over the location of the legal property boundary line and the resulting uncertainty around the accurate placement of the fence dividing the two yards. Broader neighborhood disputes or homeowner association matters are outside the scope of this problem.

**Direct and Indirect Consequences**
- Strained relationship and disputes between the neighboring homeowners
- Potential legal liabilities if one homeowner's fence illegally encroaches on the other's property 
- Emotional stress and acrimony impacting quality of life for those involved
- Decreased property values if the boundary uncertainty remains unresolved long-term

**Objectives**
- Definitively determine the legally recognized property boundaries separating the two parcels
- Gain acceptance from both homeowners of the official boundary line determination
- Relocate the existing fence to the proper location matching the legal property line
- Restore positive relations between the neighbors once the dispute is conclusively settled

**Constraints and Limitations**
- Potentially costly legal proceedings or professional land surveys required
- Difficulty obtaining clear historical property records from municipality 
- Entrenched assumptions or unwillingness by one or both parties to accept official findings
- Local laws or homeowners association rules regulating fence locations

**Assumptions**  
- The property deeds and legal descriptions can ultimately provide sufficient documentation to officially establish the true boundary line, even if presently ambiguous
- Both homeowners will eventually adhere to official determinations of the legal property line

**Stakeholder Analysis**  
- The two feuding homeowners, who have a central stake in the property dispute's resolution
- Other surrounding neighbors, minimally impacted but preferring resolution to restore peace
- The municipality assessor's office, possibly involved in legal proceedings to settle the boundary
- Land surveyors who may need to be hired to officially establish the legal property line

**Urgency and Importance**
Resolving this property line dispute through official legal channels should be considered moderately urgent. The ongoing conflict continues fueling tensions, negativity and legal risks for both homeowners until conclusively settled. Establishing clear property boundaries protects both parties' interests and legal rights over their properties.

""",
        "THE_FACTORS": 
        """
       - Ambiguities or mistakes in the original property surveys and legal descriptions defining the parcels
- Differing personal assumptions by each homeowner about where the rightful property line lies  
- Lack of motivation or ability to pursue official legal remedies to definitively settle the boundary line
- Personality conflicts or poor communication complicating neighborly relations

        **Introduction**: 
During the winter months, residents of a particular house notice that the heating system does not distribute heat evenly throughout the rooms. This creates discomfort for the occupants and leads to increased energy bills as they try to compensate for the uneven heating.

**Background**:
The house in question is a two-story, single-family home that was built in the 1960s. The heating system consists of a central furnace with vents in each room. Over the years, the system has shown signs of wear and tear, leading to inconsistent heat distribution. Previous attempts to address the issue, such as adjusting the airflow and insulating the ductwork, have only provided temporary solutions.

**Problem Description**:
The uneven heating in the house is affecting all occupants, leading to discomfort in some rooms while others remain overly warm. This has resulted in conflicts among family members and increased energy consumption as the thermostat is constantly adjusted to maintain a comfortable temperature throughout the house.

**Scope**:
This problem statement will focus specifically on the heating system within the house and its inability to distribute heat evenly. It will not address other potential issues related to insulation, ventilation, or energy efficiency within the home.

        **Introduction**: 
Citizens who are not registered to vote are not represented in the democratic process, which can lead to a lack of diverse perspectives and a skewed representation of the population. This problem undermines the fundamental principle of democracy where every citizen's voice should be heard.

**Background**: 
Over the years, there have been various efforts to increase voter registration and turnout, including voter registration drives, online registration options, and outreach campaigns. Despite these initiatives, a significant number of citizens remain unregistered, leading to a gap in political participation and representation.

**Problem Description**: 
The issue at hand is the high number of citizens who are eligible to vote but are not registered to do so. This problem affects individuals who are marginalized, disenfranchised, or unaware of the importance of voting. As a result, their voices are not heard in elections, leading to a misrepresentation of the population's diverse views and interests.
