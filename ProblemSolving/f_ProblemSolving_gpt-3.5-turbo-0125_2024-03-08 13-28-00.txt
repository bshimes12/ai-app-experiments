**Hypothesis**: Implementing sound barriers around the pickleball courts will reduce the noise levels and address the community's concerns. 

**Methodology**:

1. Select a pickleball court located in a residential area with significant noise disturbances.
2. Measure the baseline noise levels during peak playing times.
3. Install different types of sound barriers (e.g., fences, walls, vegetation) around the court.
4. Assess the effectiveness of each barrier by measuring noise levels after installation.
5. Collect feedback from residents and pickleball players on the impact of the sound barriers.
6. Analyze the data to determine the most effective barrier in reducing noise levels while maintaining the functionality of the court.

**Anticipated Results**:

- The sound barriers will significantly reduce noise levels around the pickleball court, leading to a decrease in disturbances for nearby residents.
- Residents will report an improvement in their quality of life and satisfaction with the noise mitigation measures.
- Pickleball players may initially resist the barriers, but their feedback will show an acceptance of the changes once they see the positive impact on the community.
- The most effective sound barrier solution will be identified, providing a template for implementing similar measures at other pickleball courts in the municipality.
