The human’s story is often the same: The bite came out of nowhere. But there are almost always signs. We are just bad at reading them. Everyone knows to back away from a growl, but dogs usually communicate their discomfort long before reaching that point.</p><p>Dog aggression occurs on a ladder. Initial signs of discomfort might include lip-licking, looking away or yawning. Then dogs will escalate a step to behaviors such as stiffening up, staring or crouching with a tucked tail. When even the most conscientious dog owners don’t recognize the signs, then, seemingly out of nowhere, the dog reaches the top of the ladder, feeling left with no choice but to bite that handsy toddler or overzealous house guest. A dog that is poorly socialized or in pain will escalate far faster than a well-adjusted, healthy one.</p><div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement"

That happens when the animal’s attempts to communicate are repeatedly punished — common in aversive training, which penalizes bad behavior  with physical tools such as collars that deliver electronic stimulation, prong collars that dig into the skin and choke chains that constrict the neck. While <a class="link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159117302095#" target="_blank" ><u>not backed by science</u></a>, this approach is still used in the unregulated dog-training industry.</p><div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement"

Fear-based learning can push dogs to stop engaging in any behavior, good or bad, because they are afraid to make a mistake and risk pain. This shutting down happens quickly and is easily mistaken for good behavior. But no growth has taken place,  only intimidation and loss of trust, leaving a dog in the corner with no voice. </p><p>The consequences often surface through aggression, fear, anxiety and biting that seems to come out of nowhere if you’ve missed the signs. Fortunately, it is easy to recognize shut-down dogs: They are avoidant and disengaged, and appear stiff or cautious.</p><div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement"

We also need to listen to them. On top of understanding the signals that lead to bites, it’s wise to remove a dog from a situation where it  is displaying signs of distress. Dogs  need a safe space at home to escape to when overwhelmed, especially in households with young children.</p><p>Finally, we should set and observe boundaries around petting. Don’t feel obligated to let other people pet your dog. Let’s also stop obsessing over petting other people’s dogs as soon as we meet them — and teach our children the same. Despite social media trends advising us to “<a class="link" href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/social-media-pet-all-the-dogs/" target="_blank" ><u>pet all the dogs</u></a>,” many are barely tolerant of strangers’ hands on them. Dogs that want your attention make it known, approaching with a wagging tail, soft eyes and a loose, wiggly body. If you’re the one who has to initiate the interaction, a good rule of thumb is: Don’t.</p><p>We love our dogs. We’re also responsible for them. We should respect all dogs as individuals with their own history, personality and triggers. Get to know their limits, meet them where they are, and you won’t give them a reason to send you to the ER.</p><p><i>Melonie San Pietro has a master’s degree in canine science and owns a small dog-walking business in Washington, D.C.
